 Hotel Management System (Java)

This project is a **Hotel Management System** implemented in Java.
It allows users to perform common hotel operations such as:

1.Booking rooms (single/double)
2.Ordering food for rooms
3.Checking customer & room details
4.Deallocating (checking out) rooms
5. Data persistence using **serialization** (so data remains available between runs)

 Features

* **Room Booking** – Single and Double rooms available
* **Food Ordering** – Order food items for any room
* **Room Details** – View customer details, booked rooms, and orders
* **Checkout** – Deallocate rooms when customers leave
* **Persistent Storage** – Uses file handling and serialization to save hotel state




When you run the program, you will get a menu-driven interface:

1. Display room details
2. Display room availability
3. Book a room
4. Order food
5. Checkout (deallocate a room)
6. Exit

 Example Food Menu

| Item No. | Food Item | Price (₹) |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| 1        | Sandwich  | 50        |
| 2        | Pasta     | 60        |
| 3        | Noodles   | 70        |
| 4        | Coke      | 30        |
 
 Future Enhancements

* GUI version using **JavaFX / Swing**
* Integration with **Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)** instead of serialization
* Online booking system with a web interface
